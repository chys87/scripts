	# By switching from "master" to "main", I express no opinion whatsoever on

	# My ancestors and my culture have absolutely zero role in the past
	# enslavement of people of African ancestry.  This is essentially a US-only
	# issue.  Yet, the US-centered internet industry is imposing this change
	# on everyone, wherever they reside and whatever background they have,
	# taking advantage of US dominance in this area.
	#
	# It has developed to so strange a situation where descendants of people
	# who once not only enslaved black people at home but also invaded *my*
	# motherland and robbed *my* ancestors are now accusing *me* to be not
	# respectful to descendants of *their* past slaves simply because I have
	# not moved fast enough to cross out a word they hate so much only because
	# of *their* own dirty history.
	#
	# Also, I wonder when I will have to call my master's degree something else.
